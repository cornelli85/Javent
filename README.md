# Javent
This web application allows the user to generate a random password.
It contains HTML, CSS and Javascript files. The javascript file powers the application.
Functions were created in the javascript file to ask the user to select what types of characters to include in the password. The user has to choose at least one number, one lower case letter, one upper case letter and one special character.
The user must select a password length between 8 and 128 characters.
An invalid response by the user will terminate he program and the user will have to start over.
The following screenshot link demonstrates the application's functionality https://github.com/cornelli85/Javent/blob/main/Assets/App-screenshot.png
